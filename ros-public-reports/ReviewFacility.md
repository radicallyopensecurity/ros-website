# ReviewFacility

Reviewfacility.eu was an initiative by the European Commission's DGCNECT bootstrapped in the very early days of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. 
Both governments and health institutions and society were grappling with an urgent need to deal with the immediate effects and many uncertainties of a viral pandemic - the potential scale and fallout of which was unknown. Technology was looked at for immediate relief, but this immediately evoked dystopian images. 

Techno-optimism on the one hand and at the same time serious and well-argued concerns within civil society with regards to privacy, and security: obviously a situation with a more than average risk of tone-deaf technology push that could result in broad resistance and lack of adoption due to lack of transparency and proportionality. With the wealth of expertise and reusable open source components already available within the community of the Next Generation Internet initiative, it made sense to tap into that - and stimulate the open source approach that was central to the vast majority of initiatives.

The focus of reviewfacility.eu was orthogonal to the epidemological and healthcare angle: its mission was to help mature the technology in question from multi-disciplinary points of view (e.g. security, accessibility, privacy analysis, protocol verification) - whether this concerned complete mobile contact tracing apps, components used (like the custom base45 decoder or log4j), the European Federation Gateway Service (EFGS) for interoperability of national contact tracing solutions, or the EU Digital COVID Certificate Gateway (DGCG) which was developed to share validation and verification information across all national backend servers. These efforts were looked at from a purely technical point of view, the intent was not to evaluate whether contact tracing has lived up to its promised or served its intended purposes from a epidemological or scientific point of view.
